          Welcome to <b class="color-indigo">GeCoViz</b>, 
          an online resource for fast and interactive analysis of
          genomic context conservation, covering 42 million genes and 12,221
          reference prokaryotic species spanning the entire bacterial and
          archeal phylogeny. GeCoViz permits to explore the genomic
          neighbourhood of virtually any prokaryotic gene, orthologous group
          (KEGGs, eggNOGs), or protein family (PFAM) from an evolutionary
          perspective, allowing users to identify conserved neighbouring genes
          at any level of phylogenetic resolution. To facilitate the
          interpretation of genomic contexts, GeCoViz provides a guiding
          phylogenetic tree relating the selected genomes, gene colouring
          options based on multiple sources of functional annotation and custom
          genomic conservation thresholds and scaled representation of gene
          lengths and genomic distances. The resulting graphics can be
          downloaded as scalar vector images for publishing purposes. Overall,
          GeCoViz offers an easy-to-use, comprehensive and fast interactive
          web-based tool for investigating the genomic context of prokaryotic
          genes and functions.
